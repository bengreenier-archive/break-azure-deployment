break-azure-deployment
=======================

Test different types of deployment failures on Azure (for node).

# Why?

To demonstrate the different ways continuous deployment with azure (from github) can fail.

# How?

Simple - switch to the branch for the failure you wish to repro (top left of github)
and __click the big deploy button__ in `README.md`.
